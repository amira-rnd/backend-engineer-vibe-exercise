# Vibe Coding Exercise - Candidate Preparation
## Senior Backend Engineer Position at Amira Learning

### Welcome! üëã

Thank you for continuing in our interview process. This document will help you prepare for your upcoming 60-minute vibe coding session.

### What is a Vibe Coding Session?

This is a collaborative coding session where you'll work through real-world challenges similar to those you'd encounter at Amira. Unlike traditional coding interviews:

- **You're encouraged to use AI coding tools** (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- **We care about your process** as much as your output
- **Ambiguity is intentional** - we want to see how you handle uncertainty
- **Speed and pragmatism matter** - perfect is the enemy of shipped
- **Time is limited** - 60 minutes goes quickly!

### What to Prepare

#### Technical Setup
- [ ] Your preferred development environment (ready to code immediately)
- [ ] Your AI coding assistant of choice (and any backup options)
- [ ] Node.js, Python, or .NET Core environment (your choice)
- [ ] Git for version control
- [ ] Any personal productivity tools you normally use

#### Mental Preparation
- Review AWS services: Lambda, DynamoDB, AppSync, S3
