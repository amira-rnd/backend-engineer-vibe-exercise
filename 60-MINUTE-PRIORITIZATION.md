# 60-Minute Session Prioritization Guide

## ⭐ MUST DO (Core Requirements)
Total: ~45 minutes

### Required Components:
1. **Setup & Introduction** (5 min)
   - Environment check
   - AI tool overview
   - Get candidate comfortable

2. **Two Main Challenges** (30 min total, 15 min each)
   Choose 2 from:
   - **Challenge A: Data Migration** ⭐
   - **Challenge B: API Debugging** ⭐ 
   - **Challenge C: Optimization** (only if very senior)

3. **Rapid Fire** (5 min)
   - At least 2 quick tasks
   - Tests adaptability

4. **Wrap-up** (5 min)
   - Solution review
   - Quick Q&A

## ⚡ OPTIONAL (If Time Permits)
Total: ~15 minutes

- Third main challenge (if candidate is exceptional)
- Additional rapid fire tasks
- Deeper discussion of solutions
- Architecture questions

## 🎯 Decision Framework

### Which Challenges to Administer:

| Candidate Profile | Recommended Path |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Standard Path** | A + B + Rapid Fire |
| **Strong Systems Background** | B (C++ version) + C |
| **Web/Cloud Background** | A + B (Node version) |
| **Moving Very Fast** | B + C + Full Rapid Fire |
| **Struggling** | A + B with extra hints |
| **Very Senior** | Skip A, do B + C |

### Time Adjustments:

**If Running Behind:**
- Skip third challenge
- Reduce rapid fire to 1-2 tasks
- Keep wrap-up to 2-3 minutes

**If Running Ahead:**
- Add Challenge C
- Do all rapid fire tasks
- Deeper technical discussion

## ⏰ Timing Warnings to Give

- At 13 min: "2 minutes left on this challenge"
- At 28 min: "Let's move to the second challenge"
- At 45 min: "Let's do some quick tasks"
- At 55 min: "Let's wrap up"

## 📊 Adjusted Scoring Expectations

### For 60 Minutes:
- **Excellent:** Completes 2 challenges well + some rapid fire
- **Good:** Completes 1.5 challenges + shows good process
- **Acceptable:** Completes 1 challenge fully
- **Below:** Struggles to complete any challenge

### Key Principle:
**Quality > Quantity** - Better to see one challenge done excellently than two done poorly.

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

1. **Time Management** - Interviewer must enforce timeboxes
2. **Clear Communication** - Tell candidate time limits upfront
3. **Adaptive Assessment** - Adjust difficulty based on performance
4. **Process Focus** - Watch HOW they work, not just output
5. **AI Balance** - Ensure they demonstrate both AI use AND understanding
